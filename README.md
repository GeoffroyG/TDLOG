This project aims at developping a game in Python, based on the concept of SimCity.

We are working on this project during the "Techniques de Développement Logiciel" course at Ecole des Ponts et Chaussées.
Our group is made of Pierre Desbrières, Geoffroy Gallier and Fatma Haddad.

To launch the game, run "Main.py".
